Isolation via Workspaces
Terraform workspaces allow you to store your Terraform state in multiple, separate, named workspaces. Terraform starts with a single workspace called “default,” and if you never explicitly specify a workspace, the default workspace is the one you’ll use the entire time. To create a new workspace or switch between workspaces, you use the
commands. Let’s experiment with workspaces on some Terraform code that deploys a single EC2 Instance:



TERRAFORM Workspaces


Normally terraform create resources in the default namespace
        $terraform workspace show.
To create and view new workspace 
        $terraform workspace new example1

List the workspaces
        $terraform workspace list 

Switch between workspace
        $terraform workspace selectworkspace_name
