There are different ways to pass data in AWS

Data


Remote statet file

    eg If yo are trying to use values from a resource that is stored in another terraform folder/project, you can use output the arguments in the output.tf file which then stores the argument value in the state file.
    The state file can then be refenced in another terraform project/folder.

user_data = templatefile("user-data.sh", {
    server_port = var.server_port
    db_address  = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.address
    db_port     = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.port
  })
