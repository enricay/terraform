# Nother way to store password or other sensitive data is to store in AWS secret manager, KMS etc.

# You could use the AWS Secrets Manager UI to store the secret and then read the secret back out in your Terraform code using the aws_secretsmanager_secret_version
# data source:


# password would now be 
#  password = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secrets_string


# The second option for handling secrets is to manage them completely outside of Terraform (e.g., in a password manager such as 1Password, LastPass, or OS X Keychain) and to pass the secret into Terraform via an environment variable. 

# variable "db_password{
#   description = "The password for DB"
#   type = string
# }"

# Note that this variable does not have a . This is intentional. You should not store your database password or any sensitive information in plain text. Instead, youâ€™ll set this variable using an environment variable.
